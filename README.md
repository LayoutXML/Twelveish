Twelveish is a unique Wear OS (Android Wear) Watch Face that displays the **approximate time in words** (in multiple languages). It also shows the exact time (digital clock) and day of the week on the top, date and battery percentage slightly below, a complication on the bottom (on all Wear OS versions and Android Wear versions 2.0 and greater). On top of that, Twelveish is **extremely customizable, completely free and open-source**.
